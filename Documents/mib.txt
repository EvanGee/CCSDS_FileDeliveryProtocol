The MIB is known as the management information base. 
This base holds the configuration information for users (peers or applications).
This data is used for determining how and who we can send file or commands
to. Files will not be sent to users that are not included in the MIB.

The MIB is currently configured as key value pairs. These pairs are formatted
in the JSON format. 

Here is an example of a MIB entry:
{
    "cfdp_id": 1,
    "UT_address" : 2130706433,
    "UT_port" : 1111,
    "type_of_network" : 1,
    "default_transmission_mode" : 1,
    "MTU" : 1500,

    "one_way_light_time" : 123,
    "total_round_trip_allowance" : 123,
    "async_NAK_interval" : 123,
    "async_keep_alive_interval" : 123,
    "async_report_interval" : 123,
    "immediate_nak_mode_enabled" : 123,
    "prompt_transmission_interval" : 123,
    "disposition_of_incomplete" : 123,
    "CRC_required" : 0,
    "keep_alive_discrepancy_limit" : 8,
    "positive_ack_timer_expiration_limit" : 123,
    "nak_timer_expiration_limit" : 123,
    "transaction_inactivity_limit" : 123
}


Below are the meanings of the fields for the MIB

cfdp_id
    This is the unique identifier of a peer on the network. We can start it at 1
    and increment it from there. This is an unsigned integer (32 bit) value;


UT_address
    This is an Underlying Transmission address. For example, in an IP stack, this
    would be an IP4 Ip address. This value is a decimal represenstation of an IP
    address. This particular one is 127.0.0.1. 


UT_port
    This os an Underlying Transmission port. For example, in an IP stack, this
    would be a 16 bit value -- like port 8080. Combinded with the UT_address, 
    together they form a complete UT address. The one above would be equal to
    127.0.0.1:1111. This is an unsigned integer (16 bit) value

type_of_network
    This number represents what type of network the underlying UT address takes.
    currently, the only acceptable values are 0 and 1.


default_transmission_mode:
    not implmented

MTU
    This number represents the 'maximum transmissable unit' -- this will also
    take the form of a buffer in the program. This value is the maximum size 
    packet that the application will receive.
